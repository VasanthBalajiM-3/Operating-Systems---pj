# Operating-Systems---pj
Final project for the course Operating Systems: Interface and Implementation
The synopsis of what you can learn from this repository:
  1. A shell program running on an infinite loop printing $ as the prompt
  2. Execution of out of shell commands through APIs (fork, execvp, pipe etc)
  3. Inclusion of redirection "<, >" using proper APIs
  4. Reading of the user input using fgets, parsing them using strkok to split the respective strings using a delimeter "space, | " to execute respective source codes.
Additional feature: 
 
This repository should provide a well cemented code of a shell program that could exhibit a shell program exhibiting the nature of an actual shell with few commands included. This repo can be a starting point for someone to start with shell building.
